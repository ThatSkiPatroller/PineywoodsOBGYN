                Medicine and Nuchal Translucency and Quality Review Program. She
                performs her own ultrasound, as this is a part of her job she 
                genuinely loves. Rather than waiting for a report days later, you 
                will be able to receive Dr. Suiter's assessment during the ultrasound.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Suiter strives for good pictures and has 3D/4D capabilities. 
                You will view the ultrasound on a large flat screen and can have 
                pictures emailed to you. Dr. Suiter performs ultrasounds for her 
                colleagues at request. If you are not a patient but would desire
                an ultrasound, you can request an order for an ultrasound from 
                your provider.
