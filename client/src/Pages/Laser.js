            With the loss of vaginal tone, lubrication, and elasticity, women can often benefit from CO2RE
            Intima laser treatments. With the loss of elasticity and tone, women often suffer from stress urinary

            treatment with CO2RE Intima Laser Treatment. CO2RE treatment is a safe and quick (10-15 minutes) non surgical
            treatment without incisions. It works by delivering controlled (fractional) CO2 energy which stimulates the 
            formation of collagen thus remodeling the tissue. Patient will recieve a treatment every 3 - 4 weeks for 3 
            treatments and then a single treatment a year after. "
